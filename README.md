# HCWA_Website
 Collaborative GitHub repository for the WordPress website development for the History Council of Western Australia. Using HTML, CSS, PHP/JAVA for this development (Like how we've been doing for the Josh Homework) and handing the project off with relevant documents to our client.

 Roughly sketched stages of a Wordpress Website development (To be exactly like Josh's Website, will download all the video tutorials to make it easier for us to refere back to - Jess):
 1. Figma Concepts
 2. HTML and CSS code the neccesary pages we need. *(As it will become our main base to everthing else with more differences due what this website requires compared to Josh's)*
 3. Testing by open in browser to ensure step 2 is complete done with little to no issues. *(Matches to the concepts)*
 4. Converting the HTML to PHP, Then transferring to the server on FileZilla. *(The purpose of the PHP code allow Wordpress to access it through the theme template folder)*
 5. Testing over and over, by veiwing through WordPress dashboard to ensure the convertion goes well. *(Will be doing this the whole development)*
 6. Setting up advanced custom fields to allow the clients to change the content without changing the code.
 7. Setting up Paid Membership Pro and Mailchimp add on *(It will automatically create the pages needed for a membership sign up, payment page, etc.)* to match with design composition.
 8. Animation and flair for the webpage. *(Can maybe add a free plugin to reduce lag on the website, Just need to double check with Mark)*
 9. Finalisation to remove any issues, bugs, etc.

 *These steps aren't perfect steps, just a rough idea based on the Josh Tutorial Videos*

 **Will need to organise the workload based on skill level, time availibility along side other units and etc.**
 Webpage roles each of us are developing/coding for website:
 2) ABOUT US -                                                  NAME
 2-3) WHAT MATTERS -                                            NAME
 2-3) WHAT'S ON -                                               NAME
 3) SUPPORT US (Name needs to be changed - Plugin)-             NAME   
 1) CONTACT US -                                                NAME

 **DIFFICULTY LEVEL:**
 1 - Low
 2 - Medium
 3 - High (Due to a plugin)
 
 *Changed the order of pages and removed ones based on Meagan's note during client meeting on the 09/04/24 that she has posted on Microsoft Teams.*

 Plugin Updated - The paid memberships pro plugin and the addon plugin of mailchimp is very much possible to use for the client's membership page, Mark mentions that we don't need to worry money logistics about the website being connected to their accounts as we can set it up and having a free membership payment option to test if accounts are actually being made. The only difficult part is basically 'hacking' into their style sheet/learning more about the plugin to match with our website design to make it beautiful. At the moment I've tested it out with one of my personal emails, which I might change it to my student email or something (Jess).

 Also feel free to add anything that will be neccesary as this file acts along side with the figma compositions and brief will act as a guide to the website development.
 
 Stylisation guide:
 Hightlight **Start and end of hightlighted text**
 1) Number highlight (Only with nothing else before the number on the same line)

 *With the webpages that might require plugins is only temporary as nitty gritty details needs to hashed out to see if they are actually needed or we can remove them entirely from the project. Prior to all of this though, experimentations will be conducted on the plugins using the Josh Website Homework repo folder/FileZilla server to test the fucntionality of the plugins.*
